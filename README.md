# TicTacToe with Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project is an AI-powered TicTacToe game implemented in Python, using the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to enhance the efficiency of the minimax strategy. This AI approach enables the computer to make optimal moves, making it impossible for players win.

# Learning Objectives
  - Further develop my programming skills in Python.
  - To expand my knowledge in the AI, ML, and get practical experience implemeneting ML algorithms on zero sum games. 
  - Alpha-Beta Pruning: Understand and implement Alpha-Beta Pruning within the minimax algorithm to enhance efficiency in decision-making algorithms.
  - Explore AI and Game Theory in Python: Apply game theory concepts to build an AI that makes optimal decisions in a simple game environment.
  - Enhance Problem-Solving Skills: Learn to optimize algorithms for real-time decision making, making the code efficient and effective.
